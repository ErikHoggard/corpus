# What is this, and what could it possibly be??? And why would it be useful ever, under any circumstances?????

The original idea for this project was a simple MIDI-controlled sample player
that I could use with ORCA. I'd also like to set it up as a sort of repository
for storing and managing samples across my many devices. Eventually I'd like
to add effects and configurable midi channels for various parameters when 
playing through webmidi, and quick, easy exports to annoying formats such as
Morphagene reels and Squid Salmple packs.

Currently, all you can do is load in samples (hardcoded paths), set a start and
stop point, and trigger them via MIDI (with pitch/velocity support). 

I'll update this when the app is actually somewhat useful.
